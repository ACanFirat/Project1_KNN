# Project1_KNN

Our project predicts diabetes with the KNN algorithm. Our program takes a dataset of diabetes patient as input, it can also change the dataset in the program. The code has SQL database connection. Basically, the model predicts the patient's output based on the given datasets. KNN was prepared with a test rate of 33% and looked at 11 neighbors (we compared this percentage and number of neighbors with different accuracy results). Also, the code includes the PyQt5 library and some graphical user interfaces. It includes train, predict and graphic buttons on the left side of the interface. Train performs learning in the background with the latest version of the database. The Prediction button predicts an output with the given data. The graph button gives the final version of the database. On the right side, there are create, read, update and delete buttons that will edit our database without the need to enter another program.
